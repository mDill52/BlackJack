This project is a Black Jack Game.
The player(user) starts with a $100 cash balance.
From the Main Menu the player can choose to play a hand, check their current cash balance, or exit.
If the player chooses to play, they will be asked how much money they want to bet. 
If they lose money their balance will go down, but if they win, their balance will go up. 
The player can easily check their current cash balance in between each hand, if they choose to.
If the player tries to bet more then they have available, they will receive an error.
